For convinence, there is a seeded Data existing in the application. Same can be seen in LoginDetails.json and DataStore.json


Note:

Application is becoming more time consuming when adding more functionality.
So, application is confined to limited functionality and validations.

You can verify the code style and design and understand that i can do more validations and functionality also but as i 
mentioned earlier Due to time complexity to work for my current Organization and also to develop this application on weekdays 
brought these constraints.

Hope it is understandable.

Thanks.
